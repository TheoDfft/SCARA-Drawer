# SCARA-Drawer
This repository contains code, STL files, and documentation for a SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robotic arm designed to draw precise shapes and patterns. The drawing actions are controlled by an input from a computer vision system that tracks a pen held by the user in real-time.
